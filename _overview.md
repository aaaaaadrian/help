# What is this?

A simple and cute DIR with helpful `man` style pages (more moder, more cute) for commands and concepts Adrian is trying to learn.

All markdown files created in this dir should be friendly, well organized, cute, contain layman translations for technical terms when necessary (like cruft, ehat even is that?), and real world examples for Adrian's work.

Look at [fd.md](fd.md) and [find.md](find.md) for the style.
