Kinda like `man` pages, kinda like `-h` flags. Just making it easier for me to read and reference on "common" commands like 'find', 'awk', 'grep', etc.

It's a collection of simplified pages for common *nix commands. 

Each file breaks down what the command does, common flags, and practical examples. No jargon, just straightforward reference material.
